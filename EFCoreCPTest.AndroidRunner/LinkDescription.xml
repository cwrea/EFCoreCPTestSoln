		LinkDescription.xml. Can be used to prevents runtime errors when reflection is used for certain types that
		are not otherwise referenced directly in the project, and that would be removed by the Xamarin linker.
	
		For a Xamarin.iOS project, include in build settings "Additional mtouch arguments", with real hyphens:
			[hyphen][hyphen]xml=${ProjectDir}/LinkDescription.xml

		For a Xamarin.Android project, just set this file's build action to "LinkDescription".

		Example content:
		
		<assembly fullname="System.Core">
			<type fullname="System.Linq.Queryable"></type>
